            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y an Expreſs from the Hague it is certified, That the Eſtates of the United Provinces, at a General
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118424:3"/>Councel, taking into ferious debate and conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the great and weighty Affaires of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and how the ground-work thereof, might be carryed on with the beſt advantage, in this Juncture of time againſt England, after mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, it was terminated, That a Meſſage ſhould be ſent to the King of Scots, imploring his Reſidence at the Hague; to the end, that by a mutual conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, all poſſible meanes might be uſed for the preſervation of their Religion, Liberty, Freedom, and Intereſt.</p>
            <p>This Meſſage being ſent by the Lord Boretz, &amp; preſented, a Councel was thereupon called at Saint Germans, where was preſent divers of the Engliſh Nobility, and after ſerious conſultation, mutually aſſented to leave his titular Majeſty, to the fortune of his Reſolutions, by reaſon of his ardent affection to be ſo far importuning, that he choſe rather to communicate a ſatisfactory Anſwer to the States, then any wayes to decline or wave ſo cordial an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation.</p>
            <p>In purſuance whereof, great are the preparations at the Hague for ſolemnizing of his Reception, in tryumph and honour.</p>
            <p>There is dayly Action between our Scouts, and Trumps; and this morning captain Peacock, with the Tyger, going to relieve the Guard, was ſet upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118424:3"/>by three Dutch-men, who maintained a gallant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, for the ſpace of half an hour; which our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral hearing of, diſpatched captain Watſon and captain Taylor to his aſſiſtance, who bearing up ſo drown the Countrey. The allarum whereof hath ſo exaſperated the ſpirits of many, that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly inraged, and vowes revenge.</p>
            <p>We hear that there is a general Riſing from 16 to 60; and thoſe that do refuſe to to engage, are to die without mercy. They are ſetting forth another great Fleet of 100 ſail, and the Zealanders have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen a new Admiral.</p>
            <p>Lieut. Col. John Lilburn hath cauſed a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be publiſhed at Amſterdam; wherein he ſtates the Caſe between England, and the United Provinces, in this preſent Juncture, whereby all true Engliſh-men may apparently diſcern, how much it concerneth them to be unanimous and vigilant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the motion and deſign of the Netherlanders, who are aſpir'd to ſuch a height of Ingratitude, that they would willingly forget what was their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when England firſt undertook their protection and eſpouſed their quarrel with the loſs of many thouſands Engliſh-men, and the expence of eleven hundred thouſand pounds ſterling. Amongſt the reſt, there hath been a paper of great concernment diſperſed throughout the ſeveral Provinces; a Copy whereof followeth:</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:118424:4"/>
            <q>
               <p>It is no wholeſom counſel to truſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the death of one deſcended of Royal bloud: he ſuffers him to live either through pity or policy: If he be compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, he knows not how to be cruel; if po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick, he thinks the preſent times will not laſt long; his thoughts are buſied on times to come; and he endeavours more to ſave himſelf, then to ſecure others: And whereas ſome there are, who ſay, That to take away a Kingdom, and ſuffer the King to live, is a cruel piece of charity, wherewith all Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants whileſt they go about to deceive the World, they oft-times deceive themſelves. The whole will eaſily meet together, the parts whereof are left alive. To ſet the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Vertue upon a deſpicable foundation is as much as to build a Coloſſus of Gold upon feet of dirt: Piety becomes a State, for that his Government is free: Cruelty, a Tyrant, for that he is violent; courteſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118424:4"/>the one, force is requiſite to the other: neither yet doth that ſecure him; he is not unlike a belly-god, who if he perſiſt to eat, a ſurfeit kils him; if he deſiſt, a diet; if the Tyrant bloudy his hands without reſpect, he dies for being cruel; if otherwiſe, for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be pious.</p>
               <p>In a word, that hand wil not proſper, that fights under the Banner of Tyranny; and the force and might of all thoſe wilbe mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred that fights for the intereſt of Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore, who are ye, O ye Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, that dare to ſet your ſelves againſt the Lord, againſt what he hath done, and is done in England, Scotland, and Ireland; to endeavor to ſtrike out all the glorious Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of his foot-ſteps and preſence, what his Arm hath brought to paſs for him, and his mighty Power eſtabliſhed in theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions? Who are you that dare to think, that you can root out this Cauſe, and give
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118424:5"/>the Lye to all the appearances of God, the Prayer, the Faith, the Praiſes of the Saints in thoſe Nations? Who are you that ſay their Gods, are Gods of the Hills, therefore we will fight with them in the Valleys: they ſtood againſt their own forces, but they ſhall not againſt ours: The Land is given them in poſſeſſion, but the Deep is ours, and we will ſwallow them up as in the belly of Hell? Our God is the ſame, and ſo is Our Cauſe on the Sea, as well as the Land: Spain found it ſo in the year 1588. and all others have ſince our late Wars and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
